# Phase 2 Contributions

For Phase 2 of the project I played a large role in the development of the ER digrams and implemenation of the database. Sota and I came up with ideas for the second and third personas, Andrew and Eleanore, and made respecitive databases for them. Eventually, we will generate data for these persona databases. 

Furtermore, I contributed to the Sun Yeu diagram which contains entities for the various data sources found by other members of the group. Lastly, I translated the Andrew and Eleanore ER diagrams into SQL using DataGrip. 

To fix team blog post 1, I completely rewrote two of the personas as well as project overview.
