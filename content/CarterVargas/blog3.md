## Phase 3

With Phase 3 complete our app is finally transforming from a concept to a service. Over the past couple weeks I finished my coursework in CS3200 and have used the knowledge I have gained in the development of the project. After our feedback from Phase 2, we again had to make major revamps of our project changing the student persona to an economist to which I was primarily responsible for.

## Contributions

My main contribution for phase 3 was the development of the Economist persona. I was responsible for creating the Streamlit pages of this persona, creating both the "Historical Data Viewer" and "View Favorite Policies" pages. To make these pages functional, I also created Rest API routes using Flask. I registered my own instance of the API and created 5 different routes using a mix of GET, POST, and DELETE calls. I used MYSQL to create interactive filtration for the user and ability to favorite policies. These policies are then viewable on a seperate page where more information is available. In phase 4, I plan on expanding the functionality of the economist and to incorporate some of the real data used by the other personas. The data used right now is all data I generated and inserted myself using AI.

## Other Notes

With one week to go I look forward to completing this project all of my group members have tirelessly on; however, I also don't want this program to come to an end. Everyday has been an enjoyable experience especially with this weekend's past trip to Luxembourg. Living in Europe has been a very unique and fun experience so far.
