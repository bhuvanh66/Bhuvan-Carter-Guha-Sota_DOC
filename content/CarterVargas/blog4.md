## Phase 4

This past week has been extremely busy with the amount of work and effort we have put towards this project; however, it has also been extremely rewarding with both the amount of new skills I have learned and with a robust and refined final product. It was nice to see all the features of our personas finally come together and create one fluid application.

## Contributions

My main contribution for phase 4 was finishing the Economist Persona and adding front end details. I worked with Bhuvan to expand the generated Policy Data to have three more features, budget, duration, and population. I then helped him implement his cosine similarity model into the persona by improving the existing pages to account for these new changes. I also added a politician contact information button to the view favorites page for additional information. Furthermore, I worked on the homepage to implement the multiple user functionality. Across other pages I worked to improve the visuals through CSS. Lastly, I remade the Rest API Matrix.

## Final Day In Leuven

Tomorrow is sadly the last day of this dialogue to which has been an amazing past five weeks. I'd like to thank my Professors, Dr. Fontenot and Dr. Gerber for creating this amazing dialogue. I have both learned and had so much fun during my time here in Belgium.
