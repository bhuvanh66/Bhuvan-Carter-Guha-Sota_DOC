# Week 1 in Leuven

Already one week into the program I have already learned about many topics regarding data in international politics through my classes, guest speakers from KU Leuven, and visits to institutions like NATO and the European Parliament. Accompanied with this Iâ€™ve also had fun taking trips to the Atomium and exploring the cities of Brussels and Bruge.

One of the things that have been so valuable academically so far is learning at the fundamental level how databases are structured and how to develop them yourself using Docker and DataGrip. In my previous DS classes, I have stuck exclusively to using CSV  and JSON files that were read in using libraries like Pandas- through this class so far I have expanded my ways to handle large amounts of data and I will eventually learn how to incorporate these in app development. SQL has many useful features such as dividing your data into smaller relational tables that can be accessed together through JOIN clauses.
