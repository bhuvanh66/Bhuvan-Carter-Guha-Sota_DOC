## Week 2 in Leuven

### My Contributions
My work regarding the plots included:
- Plotting the correlation between the features and targets for the **2 economic models**
- Plotting the residual plots for the First Economic MOdel
I also was responsible for the linear regression and data cleaning associated with both of the economic models
This included:
- Fetching all the data from the API and merging them together
- Figuring out how to normalize the data as there was very polarizing scales of data as some where billions of dollars and others were percentag points
- Doing the regression and finding out the $r^2$ and MSE associated with it

### My Second week in Leuven
I truly enjoyed my second week in Leuven. My trip to Antwerp was extremely enjoyable as we visited Het Steen, the oldest building in Belgium. One of the things I have loved seeing in Belgium as a whole that was very prevalent in Antwerp was the way Belgium combines modern architecture with extremely old architecture. The way the buildings are a combination of newer commercial shops built inside well maintained century-old walls is extremely pretty.
