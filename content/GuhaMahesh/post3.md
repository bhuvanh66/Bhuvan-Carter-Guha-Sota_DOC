## Week 3 in Leuven

### My Contributions
As part of my work in phase 3 of the project, I was fully in charge of creating, improving, checking the assumptions for, and integrating the SP500 & Currency model. I had already created this model last phase; however, the assumptions had all failed. To that end, I had to add lags to the model, which greatly improved the residual plots. Additionally, I created the API routes for the ML model, and page for *Sun Yue*, our Policy Maker user profile. Additionally, I helped my group-mates improve our previous personas and come up with what is hopefully our final project concept.


### My Third Week in Belgium
One of the biggest developments I have found during my third week in Belgium and our excursion to Luxembourg is a new perspective on innovation and its place in the EU and United States. Luxembourg was extremely interesting to me as it was essentially a mix of what parts of the United States look like and most of the rest of Europe. Seeing a large parking lot was both a shock and a relief. Our guest talker at the Martens Center really made my perspectives on the EU and the United States as a whole. I used to be very on board with the heavy regulation from the EU and generally felt that the United States should follow suit. However, the guest speaker really revealed the consequences that come with that. I feel as though the EU can afford to over regulate as it isn't directly competing with China on innovation the same way as the United States is.
