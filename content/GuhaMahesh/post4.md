## Week 4 in Leuven

### My Contributions to Phase 4
As phase 4 consisted mostly of creating routes to amplify the functionality of each of the personas, my part mostly consisted of making the Policy Maker's features such as the various graphs. This included creating code and tables to display different graphs and market indices based off the nationality of the user. Additionally, I helped move all the models' data to the database as opposed to being fetched from the online APIs. Lastly, I spent quite a bit of the last few days simply working on front end and ensuring that all the personas were as intertwined as possible. 

### My Final Week in Belgium
When I applied to this dialogue, I honestly was only considering it due to the unique opportunity of receiving 8 relevant credit to my major from a dialogue; my interest in Belgium was superficial, and I didn't see myself truly connecting with anyone on this dialogue. However, I've come to love Belgium quite a bit, and will come to miss Leuven quite a bit. I would like to truly thank my fellow students on this dialogue. More importantly, I would also like to thank my professors quite a bit. It would've been very easy for professors to take the opportunity to teach a dialogue for a paid excursion to a different country and simply do the bare minimum. However, Dr. Gerber and Dr. Fontenot did a wonderful job making an environment for students to both enjoy our time in Belgium and gain relevant experience and information, and I couldn't be more grateful for it.
