## Week 1 in Leuven

Though it has only been a week, I feel as though my experiences here have already set me towards a path which is conducive to success. I have greatly expanded my awareness in European Politics and Legislative Processes with the help of our visits to the EU parliament and commission.

I have learnt in my time in Belgium is that my perception of the relevance of Brussels and Belgium as a whole has been very misled and wrong. I knew that Belgium housed the headquarters of NATO in addition to being home to many of the branches of the EU; however, it's relatively small population and size led me to believe it wasn't an important player in the west. My time here has shown me that this is simply not the case. The level of diversity I have witnessed in Brussels showed me that it truly was an _international city_.
