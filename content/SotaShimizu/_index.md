Hi, my name is Sota, and I am a first year Computer Science / Biology student at Northeastern University. I am taking CS 3200, Introduction to Databases in Leuven as part of the Dialogues of Civilization programs at Northeastern, with help from the John Martinson Honors Program. I enjoy playing and watching soccer and basketball in my free time.
