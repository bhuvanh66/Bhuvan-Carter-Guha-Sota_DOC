# Week 1 at Leuven

Hello, and welcome to **Week 1** of my time in Leuven! There have already been many interesting opportunities, but my favorite has to be our first day off, spent in the beautiful town of **Bruges**. Without any plan in mind, Bruges was a fantastic area to just walk around and marvel at medival architecture. We were blessed with perfect weather, which only made the day better.

During explorations like this one, I have discovered that Belgian people are **very** friendly, to the point where it is surprising at times! At any point, you should expect a random person to walk up and ask, "Where are you from?", and start a conversation about places they know in the United States. The culture in general seems to be laid back and focused on enjoying the moment, which I appreciate greatly.
