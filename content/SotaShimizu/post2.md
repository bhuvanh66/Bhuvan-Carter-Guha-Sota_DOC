## Week 2 at Leuven

Week 2 in Leuven was very eventful, from travel to guest speakers. As a team, we focused much more on polishing the purpose of our project, and started to materialize ideas we already had.

# My Contributions
Here is a list of my contributions to the project for this week:

- Modified user personas greatly, worked on Eleanore Goosens in particular. I decided that since our current three personas were not enough to differentiate functions for different users, we should add a note-taking function to certain users. This will allow Eleanore to keep track of and view effects of policies she has discussed on one screen.

- Drafted ER (Entity Relationship) Diagrams with Carter, decided to center as much data as possible around country and country_id to make it easy to sort policy data from different sources by country (See team blog for diagrams)

- Redesigned wireframes for the project on paper. As we decided on a clear direction for functionality, I drafted a large portion of the visual representations we would like to have on paper, to reflect the newly updated user stories

- Reflected ER Diagram structure to a first draft of SQL DDL, made empty tables to represent everything we should need.


# Life Update

Belgium continues to be an amazing country with much to discover. After touring Antwerp, I returned to Brussels (third time?) and there was still much to discover in both cities! The jazz festival was definitely a highlight of the week.
