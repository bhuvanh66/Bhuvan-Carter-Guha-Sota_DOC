## Week 3 at Leuven

Many changes were made to the project this week, most notably to the database structure. Our original idea for the ER diagram was very shallow, and didn't account for actual user interaction, something that came back to bite us this week.

# My Contributions
Here is a list of my contributions to the project for this week:

- Rewrote all SQL DDL, to account for different Users accessing and interacting with the web app from a frontend perspective.

- ER Diagram was revised to go along with this change.

- Wireframes were redrafted AGAIN, I mainly worked on the Lobbyist.

- Wrote around 10 REST API routes, although some are currently not being used. I focused on finishing the Lobbyist functions. This wraps up the majority of the Lobbyist backend, barring some visuals using the model.

- ALso finished the frontend for the Lobbyist User Persona, which had many challenges with transmitting data back and forth using the REST API calls.


# Life Update

Although the project practically took over my life this week, the class trip to Luxembourg was unforgettable. One day, I was trying to grab dinner when the Luxembourg marathon happened blocked off many key roads, leading Dr.Gerber, a couple friends and I down a journey into the Luxembourg valley; such an interesting adventure with a rewarding end (Dr.Gerber paid for dinner!). Here are some beautiful pictures of the valley area.
