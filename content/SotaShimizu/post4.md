## Week 4 at Leuven

The project was nowhere near finished by the end of Phase 3, but a lot of work (especially frontend!) was done this week, making the website look much better. Although there was basically no free time this week, it was well worth the effort to see the final product.

# My Contributions
Here is a list of my contributions to the project for this week:

- Contributed around 35% of the frontend, creating title banners for each page and finishing all Lobbyist pages

- Modified logic surrounding session states to prevent a couple bugs that were occuring when doing things in specific orders

- Database was cleaned up to remove duplicate information, such as saved policies which was previously being doubly stored

- Fixed routes to correctly store information for GDP and market information which was not working

- Polished other minor bugs & prepared for the presentation


# Life Update
Dr. Gerber took us to see a soccer game, which was truly a special experience! The game was Belgium vs. Wales, and although Belgium started off strong with a 3-0 lead in less than 30 minutes, Wales had a crazy comeback to tie the game 3-3. Kevin De Bruyne had the game winner late in the second half, and it was so much fun!
