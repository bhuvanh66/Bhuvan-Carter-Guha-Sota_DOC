## Blog Post 2
# First Week in Belgium

### My Contributions
 - Brainstormed user persona 3 and potential features that would be used to predict
 - Searched for datasources that could be used to find hdi, military spending, education spending, and imports/exports
 - cleaned and processed data, which required excel parsing and removing missing points of data
 - Added Data Visualizations for all 3 features of the hdi model (military spending, educational spending, foreign aid)
 - For the educational percentage of total spending database, cleaning it required parsing through an excel database that was scraped from the web. This dataset was fairly messy and had empty rows which had to be parsed very specifically. Additionally plotting the data was difficult because I made 6 different scratterplots that showed the data by year.
[Commit with HDI EDA](https://github.com/NEU-Khoury-DoC/25su-DoC-Project-Template/commit/920801ca269e5612727c014e6ce910ac3c66fabe)
 - The foreign aid database was difficult to get working because it had a limited number of uses. Additionally, it had country codes instead of country names, so I had to create a dictionary and call the API repeatedly until the API worked. I also plotted 6 graphs by year and by export type to compare correlation between the data.
[Commit with Foreign Aid EDA](https://github.com/NEU-Khoury-DoC/25su-DoC-Project-Template/commit/e828091759a8bb4ed97f1a7d68d9b6f0dc4b9681)
 - I applied a similar process for plotting the military data as the foreign aid data, and this was relatively straight forward to plot and create.

### My Second Week in Lueven
I really enjoyed my second week in Belgium. Last weekend I visited Bruges and this weekend I visited Antwerp. I found the urban planning around water extremely interesting. The water was on the side of main streets and was definetly a part of the landscape, especially in Bruges. I also thought that the water was a great feature for wayfinding and directing people towards major attractions. I liked how integrated the canals were with the city and how many the cities roads were connected.
