## Blog Post 3
# Antwerp, Brussels, and Luxembourg

### My Contributions
 - Changed HDI model to predict GDP data instead
 - Sourced data for the GDP model, cleaned that data and simplified it to only have 8 countries
 - Created linear regression model and added time series lag and country as a feature
 - Since the data was in % of GDP, I had to convert to % of previous years GDP
 - Used log normalization and cross validated the model
 - Plotted scatterplots + residual plots for the GDP model + checked assumptions
 - Added GDP model to the backend and created route
 - Added tabs to Streamlit pages for Sam Yue and optional country feature
 - Edited About page

# Time in Luxembourg

I found Luxembourg to be extremely interesting, especially with their pupblic transit and infrastructure. After asking a tour guide, I learned that citizens in Luxembourg don't pay taxes and that most people who live in Luxembourg are foreigners. I found it interesting how an "idealistic" city could have amazing public systems but still have major problems such as drugs and labor shortage. Additionally, I found it interesting how people from France, Germany, and Belgium would come to this country to escape taxes and for its luxeries.
