## Blog Post 4
# Final Week, Genk, Brussels

I'm extremely happy with the progress our team has made over the past week with the project, especially with refining the design and working collaboratively. As the week is wrapping up, I'm realizing how much I'm going to miss Belgium and the people here!

# Genk EnergyVille Labs + Other Speakers

I found the contrast of the speakers extremely interesting, especially between the speakers who were more interested in furthering green energy initiatives and the conservative speaker who we talked to. Hearing many different perspectives in a Eurocentric enviroment broadened my perspectives and challenged what I believed in.

# Last Week

I'm extremely happy I picked this dialogue, not just because of the classes I took, but also because of the expeditions, places I visited, people, and the professors. I would like to thank Dr. Fontenot and Dr. Gerber for facilitating this program and challenging me to be a better person acedmically and socially. This experience and the people I met are definetly something I will remember long after this dialogue!
