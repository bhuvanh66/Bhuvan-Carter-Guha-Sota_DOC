## Blog Post 1
# First Week in Belgium

Hi, my name is **Bhuvan Hospet** and I’m excited to tell you about my first week in Belgium! As someone who has never traveled to Europe, this experience has enlightened me about European politics and culture.

During this trip, I was particularly interested in how the *EU Parliament* allows for a representative government of many different cultures and languages to function at such a large scale. I had never considered the challenges that the Parliament would have in unifying all of the different cultures to provide their perspectives. I enjoyed hearing about the translators and how the Parliament prioritizes cooperation and compromise to pass legislation that is mutually beneficial. 

I was additionally interested in hearing how policy perspectives are changing, especially with the United Kingdom recently exiting the **European Union** and with the war in Ukraine. I’m glad that I learned more about the supranational organizations that affect global issues.
