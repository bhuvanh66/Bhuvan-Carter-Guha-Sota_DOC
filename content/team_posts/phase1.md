## Candidate Data Sources

So far, we have been able to retreive API data regarding the following statistics from FRED across a large span of time:

- Three different types of interest rates that the EU uses for Monetary Policy (numerical)
  - The Main Refinancing Rate
  - The Deposit Facility Rate
  - The Marginal Facility Rate

- Conversion Rates Between Currencies (numerical)
  - USD to Chinese Yuan
  - USD to Euro
  - USD to British Pound
    We plan on using the USD conversion rates to find the respective historical EU exchange rates
