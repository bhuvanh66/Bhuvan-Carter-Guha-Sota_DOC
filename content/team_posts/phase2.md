As part of creating the 3 machine learning models for the first persona, we needed to first display our correlations for the data based on our features. For predicting the S&P 500 off of different monetary policies and Net Exports, we created 4 different plots
to show the linear trends by graphing the Normalized S&P predicted value on the Y and the normalized feature on the X . 
We used the following features to train the models:
- Exports Import Data 
- Average Treasury Securities Data  
- Average Discount Rate Data 
- Federal Reserve Balance Data  
As you can see, there is a strong linear trend for all 3 of these features and a weaker trend for the average discount Rate (which still indicates a slight linear trend).

After completing a linear regression, we actually found an extremely high $r^2$ value .97 and an MSE of .028, indicating a strong model.

Again, we used the same features to view the trends between the EUR/USD rates and the corresponding features. As you can see, there is once again linear patterns amongst the four graphs; however, the patterns seem to be weaker, but we havenâ€™t done a linear regression with this data yet as the API was lagging behind due to excessive usage for testing.
